What is a singleton?
Singleton ->  There is only one instance of a class
     for the entire program, and no other can be created.
     The instance is available for entire code -> is public and static!
     Warning! Static breaks the principle of object orientation.
     Use when want to have one super-object that is available everywhere
    !!! NEVER ABUSE !!! (one singleton for one object ok - enough. Not more! )
