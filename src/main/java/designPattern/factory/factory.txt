*** FACTORY ***
What is this factory pattern
Factory ->  Exists in three forms:
           * factory method
           * abstract factory
           * factory
When to use the factory pattern:
1. When there is a need to define certain objects or types of objects to be built in some intended way.
2.When there should be items that are practical and have very specific fields.
3. To deny access to creating custom objects outside the package.
4. If necessary, create this object repeatedly in many places.
